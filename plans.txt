SEO Optimization:consider adding Open Graph tags
Accessibility:meaningful alt attributes for better accessibility || 
    Consider using ARIA landmarks (<nav>, <main>, etc.) and roles to improve accessibility further.

consider saving the userâ€™s dark mode preference in localStorage 
    so that the site remembers their preference even after they navigate away or refresh the page.

To improve usability, consider closing the modal when the user clicks outside of it, in addition to using the close button.

Consider optimizing images using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG. This will help reduce load times.
Add a preload link for critical resources like fonts to improve performance: <link rel="preload" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" as="style">

CSS Improvements: consider using a CSS preprocessor like SCSS for easier maintenance and scalability.
